# cv2-video-object-detection
object detection in video stream using OpenCV

this is very light weight process, where CV based object detection is not adding extra overhead into the video streaming using RPi Camera.
memory consumption is less than 1%
CPU consuption is around 40% which is usual for video streaming using RPi camera.
